# tides-ft

This is a small program that calculates the Fourier transform of data describing the variability of
the sea water level over time due to tides. It is best suited for processing data downloaded from
https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/

The purpose is to enable checking what are the dominant frequencies in the variability of the tides
and seeing the well-known major tidal constituents
(see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_tides#Tidal_constituents).
